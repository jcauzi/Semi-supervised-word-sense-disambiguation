# Semi-supervised-word-sense-disambiguation

University project in collaboration with Mathilde Wang and LÃ©o Labat

Creation of a semi-supervised word-sense disambiguation model for french

Implements :
- neural network (for the regular supervised model)
- K-means and KNN algorithms (for unsupervised / semi-supervised models)
- data extraction / processing functions for sense-annotated data or raw data
- an autotrained model (similar to the supervized neural network with added training data created from unlabeled raw text and K-means clustering) 

See detailed report (in french) for more information
